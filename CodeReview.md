**Enhancement One: Software Design & Engineering**

For this enhancement, I chose to work on my CS 330 Final Project. This artifact was written within Visual Studio in C++ using OpenGL for 3D rendering. My plan for this enhancement was to take my scene and finish it. When I first began working on this scene in CS 330, I had to turn the project in not to my liking. It was a scene I had photographed that had a chrome battery, a paper pyramid, and a wooden block. I was only able to render the 3D objects on a simple plane, and they all shared the same texture, thus not being complete. My plan for this enhancement is to fix the texture issue so that the 3D rendering appears as the picture depicts. I also plan to clean up the source code, getting rid of all the extra, commented out code. Lastly, I want to put the objects into a "scene" so its not just objects sitting on a plane in the blackness of space. 

**Enhancement Two: Algorithms & Data Structure**

For this enhancement, I chose to work on a snippet of code I was working on earlier within my time in CS 340. I made it from the viewpoint of a store owner that could use a program to track sales as well as the amount of customers that showed up throughout the day, the month or however many inputs the owner wanted to put in the program. The reason I selected this item for enhancement is because I felt that with a little work, it could be even more helpful to a store owner. This artifact uses an array which is a very important data structure. Arrays are completely necessary to know and understand how to manipulate in many facets of coding. I plan on enhancing this artifact by adding an “average” of total sales along with the existing total amount of customers and sum of all sales. By adding an average, it is very easy to understand how much each customer is spending per shopping trip. Say you are business owner that wants to know if certain product or store rearrangement is affecting sales, you can look at the average for each day something has been added or rearranged within the store and get a better over-all understanding. 

**Enhancement Three: Databases**

For this enhancement, I am working on a table made early on in my time within class DAD 220. It is a SQL artifact that is supposed to help a mechanic/auto shop keep track of where their parts are and the information pertaining to their parts. I plan to enhance this artifact by adding additional information (brand name of parts and their availability) to my existing table. I also plan on adding another table altogether that displays information about parts that a specific store should be expecting. This is to better communicate with customers on parts that you might not have in stock but are expecting. This additional table has all the same information as the first table, along with information about what store it is coming from and when the part should be arriving to your location.
