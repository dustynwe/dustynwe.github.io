## Enhancement One: Software Engineering & Design

For this artifact, I chose to enhance a project I worked on for CS330 originally. It was created while I was attending CS330 at SNHU. It is a 3D scene involving a plane, a triangle, a battery, and a block of wood. The problem I had with this scene originally is that I could not ever figure out how to get the textures to work correctly. Only two textures would ever appear on the shapes causing a scene with basically all the same textures. 

I selected this artifact because it was a very interesting assignment in a fun class. Ever since turning in my final unfinished with the textures not how they were supposed to appear, I have been wanting to go back through and finish what I started. The components of the artifact that showcase my skills and abilities would be the code annotations and organization. The artifact was improved by putting the textures in the correct places, making the rendering appear like the actual photograph I took for representation.

As I was going back through this artifact and trying to fix the textures, I realized that back when I took CS330, I was just severely overthinking what needed to happen. I was going through and changing variable names and going into directories trying to change namespaces and such when all I needed to do was simply start the texture of the vertices input, followed by how many vertices were to be covered by the texture. NOT vertices input, followed by the vertices input I wanted it to end on like I was doing incorrectly my entire time attending CS330. The challenges were contained within figuring the texture placement out, which has been resolved. I will attach the original picture my rendering was supposed to capture, followed by my enhanced texture picture.

This enhancement certaintly demonstraed my tenacity in problem solving along with code annotations to ensure whoever is viewing the source code can pick up where I left off with no confusion.
