# CS-499 ePortfolio

## Self Introduction

Iâ€™ve been attending the SNHU Computer Science program since early 2018. I started school shortly after getting out of the Marine Corps and attended the Computer Science program at Missouri State University. Through the stress of moving and seeking employment fresh out of the military, it became to much to keep attending an on-campus university and I dropped out. When my wife told me in January of 2018 that we were expected our first born, I knew I had to change what I was doing and envisioned more gainful employment once I was finally done with school. That is when I began submitting everything necessary for Southern New Hampshire University as a fulltime online student. As of right now, I am a stay at home father with plans on landing a job within the computer science field ideally within the next couple months. SNHU has done a great job at preparing me for this journey, and now that I am less than 2 weeks away from graduation and job searching, I couldn't be happier with my decision. 

## Reflection of Education

Although it is hard to summarize all I have been taught throughout my time within the Computer Science program, I will try. Attention to detail and patience is the main attribute I would like to focus on. I cannot count how many times I had failed code because of the smallest mishaps. One instance that comes to mind is during CS 330 while trying to get my 3D render going, I kept throwing errors. After chasing the problem for a solid week or so I broke down and just emailed my code to my instructor who was quick to catch the problem, It was simply a misspelled included library. The reason I include this is because in the future, while working with clients, it is easy to get overwhlelmed at times and sometimes code can seem like it is impossible to get running, and it is somethhing so simple. I will be reminded of that instance and take the time to slow down, take a few breaths and look at the simple solutions first. Another thing of importance is testing and team collaboration. You really do not think of these things when beginning a very simple project but in the computer science world, it normally involves teams of 10's to 100's of individuals each reaching an end goal. Some of favorite times within class was when I had to work with a small group of people, bouncing ideas off of each other and giving critism to each others code. Not only is it a great practice when going forward to an actual career within this field, it is a valuable lesson for when I begin to work with clients. The ability to talk to my client about ideas, understanding their needs and having an idea of how it will look whilst coding is an essential skill. 

## Portfolio Summary

SNHU, along with all of the courses throughout the Computer Science program have helped me obtain the necessary skills and knowledge to position my self for a job within the software engineering field. CS-330 did a great job at teaching me patience and attention to detail while working on 100's of vertices and learning how to join them all together along with the textures and lighting to make a visual representation of a picture I was modeling it after. CS-340 was a great lesson on data structures and algorithms, dealing with arrays and other necessary data structures. Lastly, DAD-220 showed me the importance of MySQL dealing with tables and how to correctly structure databases to produce a finely polished work for clients.

I have learned so much more within my time with SNHU and is definitely not restricted to the classes listed above. The classes that were named are some great examples of what I went back through and enhanced throughout my time with CS-499 in preperation for my final and this ePortfolio.
