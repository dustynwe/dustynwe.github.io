## Enhancement Two: Data Structures & Algorithms

For this artifact, I chose to enhance a snippet of code I was working on earlier within my time in my CS340 class. I made it from the viewpoint of a store owner that could use a program to track sales as well as the amount of customers that showed up throughout the day, or the month or however many inputs the owner wanted to put in the program. 

The reason I selected this item for enhancement is because I felt that with a little work, it could be even more helpful to a store owner. This artifact uses an array which is a very important data structure. Arrays are completely necessary to know and understand how to manipulate in many facets of coding. The artifact was improved by me adding an “average” of total sales along with the existing total amount of customers and sum of all sales. By adding an average, it is very easy to understand how much each customer is spending per shopping trip. Say you are business owner that wants to know if certain product or store rearrangement is affecting sales, you can look at the average for each day something has been added or rearranged within the store and get a better over-all understanding. 

I did not meet any challenges while adding in the average of sales. Any information I needed was readily available with a quick Google search. I would say the may takeaway from working with this project was that there is so much more that you can do with array than I ever thought was possible. Soon I may make another array and just set up the most random, in-depth code I can just to learn more about all the options. 

This enhancement shows my understanding of arrays and how to properly use arrays to output helpful information.
