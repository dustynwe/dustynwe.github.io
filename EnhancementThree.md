## Enhancement Three: Databases

This is an artifact I made early in my time within class DAD220 while attending SNHU. It is a SQL artifact that is supposed to help a mechanic/auto shop keep track of where their parts are and the information pertaining to their parts. 

I decided to include this within my ePortfolio because it shows I have a grasp on the basics of MySQL. It shows that I am comfortable creating tables, columns within those tables, and information pertaining to the columns with all the necessary information. The artifact was improved by adding additional information (brand name of parts and their availability) to my existing table. I also added another table altogether that displays information about parts that a specific store should be expecting. This is to better communicate with customers on parts that you might not have in stock but are expecting. This additional table has all the same information as the first table, along with information about what store it is coming from and when the part should be arriving to your location. 

I did not face any insane challenges. I learned the vastness a table and its columns can have though. They can get very specific and in depth with the right amount of time. There is also a whole lot of things you can do within SQL. If I were to go back to this code someday, I would like to add some additional functionality so that it can be used via a mobile app so to speak where items can be added or deleted on command.

This enhancement shows that I have a grasp on the basics of MySQL, It also shows that I am comfortable creating tables, columns within those tables, and information pertaining to the columns with all the necessary inputs.
